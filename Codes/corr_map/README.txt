# corr_map

Display a heatmap of correlation coefficients between spectra. The function
computes the pairwise correlation matrix across rows and visualizes it using a
color-coded image with optional numeric labels. This quick view helps identify
groups of similar spectra or outliers in a dataset.
## Input
- `C` (matrix): data matrix with samples in rows.
The function creates a figure showing the correlation matrix with values annotated.
