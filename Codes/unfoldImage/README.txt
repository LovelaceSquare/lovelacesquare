 INPUT: Cube (array): A 3D numeric array of dimensions [x, y, z] representing an image cube.  OUTPUT: Matrix (array): A 2D numeric matrix of size (x*y) x z, with the spatial dimensions flattened.  EXAMPLE: % Suppose 'imgCube' is a 3D image array of dimensions 100x100x3: unfolded = unfoldImage(imgCube); % 'unfolded' will be a 10000x3 matrix – nice and flat, just like all our chemometric models like it.  DISCLAIMER: Authors and Lovelace's Square are not responsible for any existential crises  that might arise from the difficulty of this code.
